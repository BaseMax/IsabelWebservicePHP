# Isabel Web-service PHP

Provide call history reports from **Isabel** for a Call center powered by **PHP** with a **JSON web-service** interface

> I traveled to Tehran for the first time alone and visited an **IT company** there.
>
> It was my first visit to that company, They said to me they have a problem with their **telephones** at their office.
>
> They want a program to report all telephone **call history** and save it in **JSON** as a web service.
>
> So I designed a script and a hack on top of **Isabel** to get the result from isabel.
>
> I solved the problem in 20min. **Engineers** can solve any kind of problem by thinking, developing, and running.
>
> P.S: The better solution is to get data directly from Isabel's database, not a hack and dependency on cookie/session.
